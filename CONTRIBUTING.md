# Contributing Guidelines

Contributions are welcome.  Wherever possible, new features should be
introduced with unit tests.


## Style

Style for C++ code generally follows Stroustrup's style.  Names of
class member variables start with underscore (_).  Function names are
UpperCamelCase. Constants are ALL_CAPS.
